# The Night of the Hunters

*Spoilers ahead...*  

In "The Night of the Hunters", Gotham is abuzz with mixed feelings about Batman, especially after his rough handling of cops at the museum in the previous episode. Mayor Jessop tasks Commissioner Gordon with setting up a task force to catch Batman, and Gordon chooses Detective Montoya to lead it, much to the chagrin of Bullock and Flass who wanted the job. The task force tries to trap Batman with staged muggings, but he sees through their ploy. The next night, the lure of a high-speed chase fails as Batman leaves them in the dust again. The inability of the cops lands them front and center of the news the next morning thanks to Bill O'Brian, making Gotham PD a laughingstock. Harvey Dent criticizes the mayor and the task force for their failure, using every occasion he can to elevate his political agenda.

After a scolding from the mayor, Gordon encounters Batman but can't catch him as he escapes to the rooftops. Montoya brings in Dr. Quinzel's to help catch Batman. Following her advice about Batman's tendency to go after villains with "weird names and bad habits", Bullock and Flass secretly release Firefly, now calling himself Firebug, from prison. They coerce him into causing chaos to lure Batman out. Firebug sets fire to the tenements and Bullock and Flass use this as a cover to try and capture Batman. Gordon and Montoya enter the burning buildings in a rescue mission. Bullock and Flass kill Firebug as he surrenders, with O'Brian capturing the moment.

Batman and Gordon risk their lives to save kids trapped on the higher floors. Despite their heroics, the morning papers credit Bullock and Flass as the real heroes. The mayor orders a change of guard in the task force, keeping Gordon around but promoting Bullock and Flass. This episode highlights the tension between Batman and the police, and raises questions about whether Batman and Montoya will align in their pursuit of justice. 

This episode followed through with its villain of the episode theme. And while it was funny seeing batman spelt BAT-MAN in the briefing room at the start of the episode, it got progressively darker from there on. It felt more grim & mature for sure. Batman & Gordon who were once close allies, definitely have some cracks in their relationship. How Batman continues his vigilante mode of justice without Gordon's help remains to be seen.

Rating: 4/5
