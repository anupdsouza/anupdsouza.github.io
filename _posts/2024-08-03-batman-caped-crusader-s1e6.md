# Night Ride

*Spoilers ahead...*  

In Episode 6, "Night Ride", we witness a ghostly masked figure on horseback attacking a cash truck. Back at Wayne Manor, Bruce congratulates Lucius on purchasing property for the Wayne Gardens project.

Harvey is upset by negative press from Mayor Jessop and reluctantly agrees to a press event, refusing mobster Rupert Thorne's campaign support. Batman investigates the robbery, suspecting the target rather than the stolen cash. During a public train ride to improve his image, the ghost makes an appearance. Harvey is spared by the, but the other citizens are robbed. Batman later fails to capture the ghost, who vanishes through a wall.

Lucius visits the newly purchased property, which bears the same markings seen on the ghost's saddle bags. Bruce's research at the city library reveals the ghost is James Craddock, an 18th-century highwayman and member of one of Gothams founding families who was hanged for his crimes. Bruce races to Heritage Hill to save Lucius from Craddock's ghost, but physical attacks are ineffective against the specter.

Harvey faces public backlash in the press for the robbery, while Batman seeks help from Linton Midnite, who provides a ritual to banish the ghost. Alfred's noble blood is required, revealing his lineage from the Duke of Devonshire. Batman and Alfred perform the ritual, freeing Alfred from possession and capturing the ghost but not before the ghost suggesting that Alfred is keeping a secret from Batman.

Harvey's campaign struggles worsen with his biggest donors turning their backs on him, leading him to reconsider Thorne's offer.

Another solid episode showcasing Batman's signature detective work. It played with a Scooby-Doo-like theme, but with a real ghostâ€”something rare in the Bat-verse. The episode also delved into Batman's relationship with Alfred, hinting at a mysterious secret Alfred might be keeping. Harvey, usually confident and charismatic, starts showing signs of vulnerability in desperation. This shift hints at potential developments in his character.

Rating: 4.6/5
