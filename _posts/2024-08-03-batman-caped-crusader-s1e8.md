# Nocturne

*Spoilers ahead...*  

Episode 8, "Nocturne",  begins with kids Dickie and Jason sneaking out to see the "Carnival of Human Oddities." Dickie follows a mysterious girl, Natalia, into the tents. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne and his date, Julie, are photographed at the carnival, which Bruce praises as Harvey Dent's initiative. Bruce chats with Dr. Leslie Thompkins, who brought orphanage kids to the carnival.

Inside, a mad scientist, Dr. Anton Knight, puts on a show where Natalia volunteers and gains super strength. Jason follows her, finding Dickie weak in a trailer. Natalia drains energy from Jason but is stopped by her brother, Anton. Dr. Thompkins tells Harvey about a missing kid, but he dismisses it. Bruce overhears and goes looking for the kid, ending up knocked out by carnival performers.

Bruce wakes up, changes into Batman, and interrogates the carnival workers. Natalia continues draining kids, with Anton warning her to keep a low profile. Natalia wants to kill the kids to cover their tracks, but Anton opposes her. In a fit of rage, Natalia attacks Anton, leaving him trapped. Batman finds the missing kids and Anton, who explains Natalia's energy-draining affliction. Before he dies, Anton warns Batman that Natalia needs to be brought inside before sunrise.

Batman confronts Natalia as she attacks another girl, Carrie. A fight ensues, with Batman trying to avoid hurting Natalia as she tries to drain his energy. Carrie helps by hitting Natalia with a slingshot, allowing Batman to inform her of Anton's death. Natalia breaks down, and as the sun rises her skin starts to burn up. Batman shields her and takes her away to the hospital.

Meanwhile, Harvey Dent accepts campaign money at the carnival from Rupert Thorne in exchange for dropping charges against a scammer Mulligan. But in court, Harvey surprises everyone by refusing to withdraw the charges. Afterward, Thorne's henchman ambushes Harvey and throws acid on his face.

Overall, this episode blended supernatural elements yet again but it didn't feel repetitive. It also added some humor via a minor detail with Alfred reading a ghost novel given his tryst with the ghost of Craddock in a previous episode. Batman saves the day, but Harvey's moral stand has dire consequences.

Rating: 4.2/5
