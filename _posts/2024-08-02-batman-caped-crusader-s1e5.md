# The Stress of Her Regard

*Spoilers ahead...*  

Episode 5 of Batman: Caped Crusader, titled "The Stress of Her Regard",  kicks off with Batman saving a possessed former real estate baron, Fletcher Demming, from walking into traffic. Dressed like a Pharaoh, Demming's odd behavior puzzles Batman and Alfred, who wonder how he got out of Arkham and why he donated all his wealth.

We then meet see a clown-costumed inmate tortured into donating his possessions, hinting at a sinister influence. Meanwhile, Barbara talks to Dr. Quinzel at a cafe, losing hope for Gotham, while Montoya bumps into them expressing concern for Gordon since Bullock and Flass' promotion. Quinzel arranges a dinner date with Montoya.

Batman finds payments to Dr. Quinzel in Demming's office but is interrupted by Bullock and Flass along with armed guards, who are easily outmatched. Quinzel traps another businessman in her "Playpen," coercing him to renounce his possessions.

Barbara visits Demming, now back at Arkham, where he pleads for help, still believing he's a Pharaoh. She suggests a psych evaluation with Dr. Quinzel, which Demming finds familiar. Later, Barbara meets Quinzel, who denies knowing Demming but mentions her date with Montoya.

Suspicious, Barbara investigates Quinzel's office, finding it ransacked and Batman fleeing. She discovers Demmingâ€™s appointment in Quinzel's diary and visits another victim, William Hastings, who angrily turns her away. Batman assures Barbara he'll handle Quinzel.

Quinzel's date with Montoya is cut short, and Batman discovers her Playpen. Now Harley Quinn, she unleashes brainwashed inmates on Batman, trapping him in a cell. Barbara tries to free Batman, and as the house is set to explode. Quinzel having spotted Barbara's car, returns to rescue her. Batman and Barbara escape, but Quinzel seemingly falls to her death. Montoya gets a call from Quinzel, promising to return and asking her to look out for Barbara.

This episode raises the stakes, revealing Quinzel's true intentions and setting up a potential alliance between Barbara and Batman against a returning Quinzel, possibly with the Joker. Overall, it made for very interesting viewing.

Rating: 4.2/5
