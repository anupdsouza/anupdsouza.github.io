# Savage Night

*Spoilers ahead...*  

Episode 10, "Savage Night", starts with Barbara Gordon visiting Harvey Dent. She convinces him to let her be his attorney and to undergo a psych evaluation. Meanwhile, Thorne plans to take out Harvey before he can testify.

Barbara assures Harvey she has a plan to get him into a private hospital as well as a lenient sentence, but he’s skeptical. Batman visits Barbara to offer help with Harvey's case. Later, Bruce visits Harvey, urging him to cut a deal. Harvey feels it's unfair that he gets special treatment despite what he's done.

Before Harvey's hearing, Flass and Bullock kidnap him, but Barbara follows and helps him escape. Harvey wants revenge on Thorne, and Barbara cuffs herself to him to keep him safe and from acting on his thoughts. They head to the docks, pursued by Flass, Bullock, and Thorne's men. Batman, Gordon, and Montoya meet them there to protect Harvey until he can testify before a judge.

As chaos ensues at the docks, Harvey gets shot while trying to protect Barbara. Despite Barbara’s efforts, Harvey dies in her arms. Gordon asks Batman to leave before calling it in. Back at the Batcave, Batman reflects on Harvey's death, seeing similarities between themselves but Alfred reassure him that Batman still has his humanity which Harvey lost. Batman thanks Alfred, realizing how much work Gotham needs.

The episode ends with a mysterious figure injecting a man who laughs maniacally.

This finale wraps up the first season with the extent of crime in Gotham exposed as well as having alliances tested. Harvey's death is a shock, leaving Batman without not only a dear friend but also an ally. Barbara, who has now lost both Quinzel and Dent, people who took a turn for the worst, faces an uncertain future with mob bosses already gunning for her. How Gordon keeps her safe when he can't trust anyone at GCPD is anyone's guess. The odds are stacked against Gotham's saviours as the next season sets the stage for more villains and challenges. Maybe some new and maybe some returning.

Rating: 4/5

# Season rating: 4/5
Season one followed the original animated series in style but sometimes lacked substance. Given the runtime, theres only so much it can do but it managed to pick things up towards the end. Nonetheless, I'm hopeful for what the next season brings.
