# The Killer Inside Me

*Spoilers ahead...*  

Episode 9, "The Killer Inside Me", starts with Harvey Dent dreaming about becoming mayor, but the cheers of the crowd soon change into jeers as they turn on him, calling him a monster because of his disfigured face. He wakes up, his right side still bandaged from the acid attack. Harvey has resigned as DA, and Pete Mitchell takes over, much to Harvey's displeasure. 

Gordon is frustrated that no suspects have been caught, while Montoya thinks Harvey is hiding something. Bruce visits Harvey and tries to cheer him up by taking him to a restaurant, but Harvey's mood swings make the outing uncomfortable. Harvey ends up revealing his disfigured face and his disturbed psyche in a fit of rage.

At the Batcave, Alfred, sympathetic of Harvey, criticizes Bruce's approach of getting Harvey to divulge the details of his attacker in a public setting. Meanwhile, Harvey's mental state deteriorates, leading him to brutally assault and shoot a mugger. Montoya visits Harvey's apartment, only to find it empty. Harvey is at a bar, pressing Thorne's enforcer Emil Potter for information on Tony Zito, the man who disfigured him. Emil eventually gives up Tony's girlfriend's name, Maggie Cain. Harvey beats Emil to a pulp for calling him a freak.

Alfred tells Batman about Harvey's encounter with Emil, suggesting Thorne is behind the attack. Harvey threatens Maggie into giving up Tony's safehouse address. Batman visits Emil in the hospital and then Maggie to learn about Harvey and Tony's whereabouts. Harvey finds Tony and shoots and kills his associates. After getting a confession about Thorne's involvement, he sets the place on fire, killing Tony.

Bullock tips off Thorne about Harvey's actions. Harvey storms Thorne's house, demanding justice and killing Thorne's men. As he's about to kill Thorne, Batman intervenes. A fight ensues, giving Thorne a chance to escape. Harvey eventually begs Batman to lock him up, disgusted by the actions of his perceived alter-ego. In prison, Barbara visits Harvey as his legal representative.

A banger of an episode, it was probably the darkest of the series as well as it's best so far, showing Harvey's transformation from a reformer to someone seeking revenge. Not being able to save his best friend must feel like a gut punch to Batman who might just realize Harvey is beyond saving. Barbara's involvement with Harvey given their tumultuous past adds an intriguing twist. The circumstances might just prove to be too difficult for Harvey to escape from, with any chance of redemption seeming bleak.

Rating: 4.6/5
