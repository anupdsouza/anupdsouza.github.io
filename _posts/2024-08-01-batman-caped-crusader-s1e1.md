# In Treacherous Waters

*Spoilers ahead...*  

The first episode of Batman: Caped Crusader, “In Treacherous Waters” reintroduces us to a reimagined Gotham. We start with Clarence, an underling, being interrogated by Iggy, who suspects he is a mole working for crime boss Rupert Thorne. Clarence fails to confess, and we see The Penguin step out of the shadows, taking charge. There is only one way this'll end.

Next, we see thugs working for Rupert Thorne moving contraband in a warehouse in a hurry in anticipation of a hit. The lights go out, fear spreads, and Batman voiced by Hamish Linklater attacks. He takes down the thugs but barely escapes as the warehouse explodes. It’s the third such Thorne-connected warehouse to go up in flames recently. Back in the cave, Batman and a more portly Alfred suspect a gang war. This is the first change fans of the original series are likely to notice. 

We then meet Barbara Gordon, a defense attorney with strong morals, and a cocky but well meaning DA Harvey Dent pitted against each other in a courtroom setting. Barbara dislikes him for his coin flipping ways and disregards his mayor badge as he makes known of his political ambitions. We then see Batman interrogate fire inspector Wilford Lee atop a gargoyle while a train is heading straight for Lee. As always, Batman succeeds in getting information on the warehouse explosions, the perpetrator being the Penguin.

Later, Penguin hosts a police fundraiser on her yacht(yes, you read that right), the famous Iceberg Lounge. Bruce Wayne arrives late & sneaks away to investigate. Although he discovers contraband below deck, he is forced to make a quick, wet escape when Penguin approaches, adding bits of humor to the scene. On board the Iceberg Lounge, we're also introduced to Commissioner Jim Gordon, stoic as ever as he is drawn into a squabble between Barbara & Harvey, much to his amusement. Penguin later believes she has found the mole & gets rid of it in a sinister way. This iteration of the Penguin or 'Mama' is much darker than you'd imagine.

Next, Barbara and the actual mole get caught in a high-speed gun chase. Cornered, Barbara witnesses Batman in action as he intervenes with his Batmobile. Towards the end, hell sort of breaks loose, disrupting Gotham’s crime world and setting the stage for new villains. Batman doesn't like it one bit.

All in all the first episode does well to set the stage for the rest of the series. As with most re-boots it doesn't set the world alight but does just enough to keep you hooked. Keeping in style with the original series, accompanied by a great voice cast & top notch animation the episode provides a great setup for what's to come.

Rating: 3.5/5
