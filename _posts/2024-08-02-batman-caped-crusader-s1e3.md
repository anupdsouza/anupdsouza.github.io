# Kiss of the Catwoman

*Spoilers ahead...*  

Episode 3 of Batman: Caped Crusader, titled 'Kiss of the Catwoman', kicks off at Gotham Museum with Bruce Wayne checking out the Wayne Collection. While there he is approached by Selina Kyle(Christina Ricci), who flirts with him and invites him for a drink, but he declines. Instead, Bruce punches a guy who badmouths his family, and the incident gets caught by the press, landing Bruce in hot water with a felony assault charge. It seems Bruce hasn't learnt anything about staying out of the limelight given the events with Yvonne Frances in the previous episode. To avoid jail time, Bruce has to undergo therapy with Dr. Harleen Quinzel(Jamie Chung). During their sessions, she brings up his parents, causing Bruce to revisit his memory of their tragic death in the alleyway.

We then see Selina Kyle living a carefree life, ignoring responsibilities like paying bills and dealing with her maid, Greta(Jackie Hoffman). By night, she becomes Catwoman, stealing jewels to make ends meet. Batman catches her in the act, and she's arrested but manages to get off the hook with Harvey Dent's help, much to Barbara's displeasure. She can't kick the habit though & therefore Selina quickly resumes her thieving, and after a run-in with Batman that ends in a kiss, she escapes. She and Greta, along with all her cats, move to a rundown building. Bruce continues his therapy sessions, with his reputation hit by his numerous one-night affairs.

Batman is determined to put Selina behind bars. He enlists photographer Bill O’Brian to help him capture her photos. Back at the museum, Batman confronts Catwoman, who shows up with a big cat. Batman uses sleeping gas to handle the cat and later patches up Catwoman's leg after she's shot by cops. In the ensuing melee, he also takes out the cops which get captured on film. Afterward, Batman tells O’Brian to publish the photos, even if they make him look bad. At the police station Selina phones Greta back at home to bail her out by selling some of the items. Greta however, informs her that she has already sold all of her stuff as Selina owed her pay & leaves for a cruise to the Bahamas leaving Selina infuriated.

Back at the Batcave, Alfred warns that things will get tougher, but Batman brushes off his questions about therapy.

This episode felt a step down from the previous one. Although it introduced us to Selina Kyle, her chemistry with Bruce felt rushed. Bruce's devil may care attitude is unlike what we've known him for. Whether this will come back to haunt him remains to be seen. The introduction of Dr. Quinn however is probably a harbinger of the Joker's appearance soon. 

Rating: 3/5
